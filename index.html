                <p>"Bucky" coined the phrase "Spaceship Earth" to describe our planet. He felt that all human beings were
                    passengers on Spaceship Earth, and, like the crew of a large ship, people had to work together in
                    order to keep the planet functioning properly.<br><br>
                    He was an American engineer, architect, and futurist who developed the geodesic dome—the only large
                    dome that can be set directly on the ground as a complete structure and the only practical kind of
                    building that has no limiting dimensions (i.e., beyond which the structural strength must be
                    insufficient).

                    Conceived and designed in the late 1920&#8217s but not actually built until 1945, the Dymaxion House
                    was Fuller&#8217s solution to the need for a mass-produced, affordable, easily transportable and
                    environmentally efficient house. <br> <br>
                    The house used tension suspension from a central column or mast, sold for the price of a Cadillac,
                    and could be shipped worldwide in its own metal tube. Toward the end of WW II, Fuller attempted to
                    create a new industry for mass-producing Dymaxion Houses.

                    R. Buckminster Fuller was a renowned 20th century inventor and visionary born in Milton,
                    Massachusetts on July 12, 1895. Dedicating his life to making the world work for all of humanity,
                    Fuller operated as a practical philosopher who demonstrated his ideas as inventions that he called
                    “artifacts.” <br> <br> <br>

                    Fuller did not limit himself to one field but worked as a "comprehensive anticipatory design
                    scientist" to solve global problems surrounding housing, shelter, transportation, education, energy,
                    ecological destruction, and poverty. Throughout the course of his life Fuller held 28 patents,
                    authored 28 books, received 47 honorary degrees. And while his most well known artifact, the
                    geodesic dome, has been produced over 300,000 times worldwide, Fuller’s true impact on the world
                    today can be found in his continued influence upon generations of designers, architects, scientists
                    and artists working to create a more sustainable planet. <br> <br> <br>
